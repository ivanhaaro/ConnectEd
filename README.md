# ConnectEd

ConnectEd is a side project focused on data integration, utilizing Python and FastAPI to build an API that streamlines the harmonization of diverse databases containing school data from different provinces in Spain. The goal of ConnectEd is to provide a unified interface for retrieving consistent data from various sources, including CSV, XML, and JSON formats.

## Project Overview

In the realm of education, accessing and analyzing school data from multiple provinces in Spain can be a challenging task due to differences in data formats and structures. ConnectEd aims to address this challenge by providing an efficient solution for integrating and harmonizing disparate datasets into a cohesive API.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration:** ConnectEd facilitates the integration of school data from CSV, XML, and JSON files, ensuring that information from diverse sources can be harmonized and accessed through a single interface.
- **Consistent Retrieval:** The API standardizes data retrieval processes, enabling users to access consistent and structured information regardless of the original format or source of the data.
- **FastAPI Framework:** Built with FastAPI, ConnectEd offers high performance and asynchronous request handling, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data retrieval requests efficiently.
- **Scalability:** The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the seamless addition of new data sources and expansion to accommodate future requirements.
